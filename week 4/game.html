      Clash Royale is a real-time multiplayer game starring the Royales, your
      favourite Clash characters and much, much more. Collect and upgrade dozens
      of cards featuring the Clash of Clans troops, spells and defenses you know
      and love, as well as the Royales: Princes, Knights, Baby Dragons and more.
      Knock the enemy King and Princesses from their towers to defeat your
      opponents and win Trophies, Crowns and glory in the Arena.Clash Royale is
      a free-to-play real-time strategy video game developed and published by
      Supercell.[1] The game combines elements from collectible card games,
      tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena. The game was released
      globally on March 2, 2016.[5][6] Clash Royale reached $1 billion in
      revenue in less than a year on the market.[7] In three years, Clash Royale
      made $2.5 billion in revenue according to market intelligence company
      Sensor Tower.[8] It is the first spinoff of Clash of Clans.lash Royale is
      a tower rush video game which puts players in games featuring two or four
      players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most
      opposing towers, with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an
      instantaneous win.[9] After three minutes, if both of the players/teams
      have an equal number of crowns or none at all the match continues into a
      2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an opposing tower
      wins instantaneously. If no towers are destroyed during overtime, there is
      a tiebreaker, where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the
      least health is destroyed. If two towers have the same health, there is a
      draw.[10] In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their number of trophies.
      Players level up by gaining Experience points through donating and
      upgrading cards. King Tower levels can reach level 14, and player levels
      can reach level 50; these factor into the competitive match-making.
      Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles. A player wins a
      battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower
      being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's
      Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's
      Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a rare
      draw).
